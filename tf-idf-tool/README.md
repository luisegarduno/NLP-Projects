# Tf-Idf tool

The _Tf-Idf tool_ is a python script that helps do document analysis. Once a user inputs their own sentences/documents,
the script will then go through and calculate several different types of tables/values, such as the following:
* Raw Term Frequency (TF)
* Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)
* TF-IDF
* Cosine Similarity scores
* Cosine normalized document vectors
* Log Normalization as TF
* Inverse Frequency smoothing as IDF
* Rocchio Algorithm
* And many more!

## Prerequisites

* Coming Soon

## Instructions

1. run `main.py`
2. paste your sentences
3. Coming Soon
