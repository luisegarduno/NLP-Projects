### Does co-reference resolution improve information extraction?

Co-reference resolution problem is the problem of relating references within text documents.     
For instance, "John arrives here at 10am. He is carrying a box of books.". Co-reference resolution’s goal is to find out that “He” is referring to John.

The goal of this part of the project is to apply co-reference resolution to text documents before applying the information extraction algorithm to see if there is any improvement.
